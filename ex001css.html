    <h2 style="background-color: pink; color:black" >Pink + White </h2>
    <p style="background-color: pink;">In the wake of a hurricane<br>
        Dark skin of a summer shade<br>
        Nosedive in the flood lines<br>
        Tall tower of milk crates<br>
        It's the same way you showed me<br>
        Cannonball off the porch side<br>
        Older kids trying off the roof</p>

    <h2 style="background-color: rgb(93, 195, 197); color:black"> Thinking Bout U </h2>
    <p style="background-color: rgb(93, 195, 197);">No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it<br>
        Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho, since you think<br>
        I don't love you I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you<br>
        Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down<br>
        I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)<br>
        I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)<br>
        I've been thinking 'bout you<br>
        Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya? </p>

    <h2 style="background-color: lightpink; color: black;"> ALL MINE </h2>
    <p style="background-color: lightpink; color:black"> We both still young, so what's the rush?<br>
        The night is young and we not drunk enough<br>
        You come around if I don't do too much<br>
        We had our downs but we had way more ups, let's make love<br>
        That be the reason that you always hit me up (I swear)}<br>
        You like the way I fuck 'cause I get rough<br>
        You told me your new man don't make you nut, that's a damn shame<br>
        You come here, I'll knock your pussy out the damn frame<br>
        Remember that last time I made you miss your damn plane?<br>
        Remember that last time I wet you down with champagne (remember that?)</p>

    <h2 style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black;"> Dead Man Walking </h2>
    <p style="background-color: lightgreen; color: black;"> You can do what you wanna<br>
        Live how you wanna<br>
        Spend what you wanna<br>
        Be who you wanna be<br>
        A young stunna till I DIE<br>
        Fuck it. I just run it up before I go<br>
        Would you tell the world my secrets if I let you close?<br>
        M.I.A: Missing in action<br>
        ‘Cause these days no Kumbaya<Br>
        Niggas be blasting<br>
        Living in the midst of this shit might drive you mad<br>
        Feeling pretty mixed up, but this life shit ain’t all bad </p>
